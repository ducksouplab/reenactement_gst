A high-performance GStreamer video filter plugin for real-time head reenactment using **LivePortrait** and **TensorRT 10**.

## Overview

`gst-liveportrait` is a C++ GStreamer plugin designed to animate a static source image using a driving video stream. It leverages NVIDIA TensorRT for ultra-fast inference, achieving real-time performance on modern GPUs by orchestrating multiple specialized neural engines.

This implementation is based on the architecture and custom CUDA kernels defined in the [FasterLivePortrait](https://github.com/warmshao/FasterLivePortrait) repository.

## Features

- **High Performance:** Achieves ~45 FPS (~22ms latency) on an NVIDIA RTX A5000.
- **Asynchronous Pipeline:** Utilizes Pinned Memory (`cudaMallocHost`) and `cudaMemcpyAsync` with a dedicated `cudaStream_t` to eliminate PCIe bottlenecks.
- **Full Engine Integration:** Orchestrates 7+ TensorRT engines (Appearance, Motion, Warping, Stitching, Landmark, etc.).
- **Specialized Retargeting:** Includes dedicated logic for Eye and Lip retargeting to ensure realistic facial expressions.
- **Stitching Engine:** Integrated alignment correction to maintain natural head proportions.
- **Motion Smoothing:** Implements the One-Euro filter to eliminate high-frequency facial jitter.
- **GStreamer Native:** Subclasses `GstVideoFilter` for easy integration into standard Linux video pipelines.

## Plugin Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `config-path` | `string` | Path to the directory containing the TensorRT engines (e.g., `./checkpoints`). | `NULL` |
| `source-image` | `string` | Path to the static source image (e.g., `assets/test_image.jpg`). | `NULL` |
| `enable-eye-retargeting` | `boolean` | Enable dynamic eyelid closure and gaze control. | `false` |
| `eyes-open-ratio` | `float` | Target ratio for eye closure (0.0 = closed, 1.0 = open). | `0.0` |
| `eye-retargeting-strength` | `float` | Multiplier to amplify the eye closure effect (e.g., 1.5 or 2.0). | `1.0` |
| `gaze-x` | `float` | Gaze direction horizontal (-1.0 to 1.0). *Requires gaze-enabled engine.* | `0.0` |
| `gaze-y` | `float` | Gaze direction vertical (-1.0 to 1.0). *Requires gaze-enabled engine.* | `0.0` |

## Dynamic Eye Retargeting

This feature allows you to override the eye movements from the driving video with manual controls. To use it, you must compile the `eyeblink.engine` using the official `stitching_eye.onnx`.

### 1. Download and Compile the Eye Engine
```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/warmshao/FasterLivePortrait/resolve/main/liveportrait_onnx/stitching_eye.onnx
docker run --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace ducksouplab/liveportrait_gst:latest \
    python3 compile_trt.py 
```

### 2. Usage in Pipeline
```bash
gst-launch-1.0 ... ! liveportrait config-path=./checkpoints source-image=img.jpg \
    enable-eye-retargeting=true eyes-open-ratio=0.0 eye-retargeting-strength=1.5 ! ...
```

## Source Image Constraints

To achieve the best reenactment quality, the `source-image` should ideally follow these guidelines:

-   **Face Orientation:** The person should be front-facing with a neutral expression.
-   **Lighting:** Clear, even lighting on the face (avoid heavy shadows).
-   **Resolution:** While the plugin accepts any resolution, it internally performs a **center-crop to a square** and resizes it to **256x256** (for motion) and **224x224** (for landmarks).
-   **Aspect Ratio:** For the best results, provide a square image where the face is centered. If the image is not square, the plugin will automatically take the center square based on the shortest side.
-   **Background:** Simple or static backgrounds are recommended to prevent warping artifacts at the edges of the face.

## Technical Insights (Learnings)

To achieve parity with the original repository, several critical nuances were implemented:

1.  **Landmark Resolution:** The Landmark engine strictly requires a **224x224** input resolution. Using 256x256 results in "wide open" eyes due to coordinate scaling mismatches.
2.  **Multi-Output Landmark handling:** The `landmark.trt` engine provides multiple output tensors. The actual 203 coordinates required for retargeting are located in the **third output tensor (index 2, named "856")**.
3.  **Rotation Matrix Order:** LivePortrait uses a specific Euler angle order: **`Ry * Rx * Rz`**. The final rotation matrix must also be **transposed** before being applied to the keypoints.
4.  **Relative Expression Formula:** To prevent "expression overdrive," the transformation strictly follows:  
    `x_d_i_new = x_s + (x_d_i_new - x_s) * multiplier`, where `x_s` is the source keypoint base.

## Installation & Build

The plugin must be built within the provided Docker environment to ensure all dependencies (TensorRT 10, CUDA 12, GStreamer 1.28) are met.

### 1. Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t ducksouplab/liveportrait_gst:latest .
```

### 2. Export TensorRT Engines
Follow the instructions in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (Phase 1) inside the container to download ONNX models and export them to `.trt` files.

### 3. Compile the Plugin using Docker
Run the following command from the project root:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace ducksouplab/liveportrait_gst:latest bash -c "mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)"
```

## Usage

### GStreamer Pipeline Example (with Audio)
```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace ducksouplab/liveportrait_gst:latest bash -c "\
    GST_PLUGIN_PATH=./build gst-launch-1.0 \
    filesrc location=assets/video_example.mp4 name=src ! decodebin name=dec \
    dec. ! queue ! videoconvert ! \
    videocrop left=280 right=280 ! \
    videoscale ! video/x-raw,width=512,height=512,format=RGB ! \
    liveportrait config-path=./checkpoints source-image=assets/test_image.jpg ! \

```

### Python Wrapper
A portable Python wrapper `liveportrait_process.py` is provided. It runs the entire GStreamer pipeline inside Docker, meaning you only need Python and Docker on your host machine.

```bash
# Basic Usage
python3 liveportrait_process.py \
    --input assets/video_example.mp4 \
    --output outputs/result.mp4 \
    --source assets/test_image.jpg \
    --config checkpoints/
```

# DuckSoup usage
If running these plugins within DuckSoup, copy the .so files to your DuckSoup plugin repository.

# First remove old .so files from your path, for instance, if you are using a deploy user to run ducksoup, something like:
# Make sure that you don't need the files, this will remove the files from your computer!
sudo rm -r /home/deploy/deploy-ducksoup/app/plugins/liveportrait_gst.so

#Now copy the new files:
sudo cp -r mp-out/plugins/liveportrait_gst.so /home/deploy/deploy-ducksoup/app/plugins/liveportrait_gst.so

#Also copy the required models (TensorRT engines):
# Ensure you copy all the .trt files from your checkpoints/liveportrait_onnx/ directory
# to the location expected by your DuckSoup configuration.
